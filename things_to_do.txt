Evaluation criteria
Note: When grading this assessment, the aesthetics will NOT be considered (it will
be evaluated in the next assignment).
To pass with 5 points it is necessary to satisfy the following criteria completely:
    YES  All the needed files to run the application have been submitted on time.
    YES  The code was stored in a git repository and this repository is private.
    YES  The file uploaded to Moodle contains a git repository.
    YES  The script populate.py exists and is functional.
    YES  The application can be executed locally.
    YES  When running the tests in local, the number of fails is not larger than four and
    the code that satises the tests is functional.
    YES  The code of the tests was not modied.
    NOT YET  The application works against the database created in https://neon.tech
    and implemented using PostgreSQL.
    YES  The database admin application is deployed and accessible in the local Django
    server using as user name and password alumnodb.
    YES  It is possible to create and remove objects belonging to all the requested models
    using the admin application.
    NOT YET  IMPORTANT: we need https://neon.tech URI in order to grade this assignment. Please write it down in a le called env and place it in the proyect
    root directory.
If the following criteria are accomplished, a grade up to 6.9 might be achieved:
     All the criteria in the previous paragraph are totally satised.
    NO  The application is deployed in Render.com. In the le settings.py the path to
    Render.com is assigned to the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS. Besides being deployed,
    the application works correctly in Render.com.
    NOT YET  The code submitted to Moodle is identical to the one deployed in Render.com.
    NOT YET  The database admin application is deployed and accessible in Render.com using
    as user name and password alumnodb.
    NOT YET  It is possible to create and remove objects belonging to all the requested models
    using the admin application.
    YES  All the templates inherit from base.html.
    NOT YET  IMPORTANT: If you update the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS using a enviroment
    variable add it to the env le.
If the following criteria are accomplished, a grade up to 7.9 might be achieved::
     All the criteria in the previous paragraph are totally satised.
    NOT YET  Render.com is deployed in production mode. DEBUG=FALSE and SECRET_KEY is
    not stored in settings.py.
    YES  All the views (classes/methods implemented in views.py) inherit from classes.
    NOT YET  When the tests are executed, the number of fails is not larger than two and
    the code that satises the tests is functional.
    NOT YET  The code is readable, ecient, well-structured, and commented.
    IG  The tools provided by the framework are used.
     The following are examples of the previous points:
        YES?  Every form that involves a model is created in such a way that it inherits
        directly or indirectly from class forms.Form.
        YES  The searches are done by the database. Do not not load all the elements
        of a table and implement the search in the views dened in view.py.
        NOT YET  The errors are properly processed and understandable message errors are
        returned.
        NOT YET  The code presents a consistent style and the functions are commented
        including their author. Note: the author of a function must be unique.
        NOT YET  The style criteria highlighted by Flake8 are applied in a coherent way.
        Flake8 does not return any error when executed on the code programmed
        by the student.
    CHECK It is impossible to impersonate a user (or participant) without knowing their
    user name and password (or game.publicId). For example: (a) it is not possible to modify a questionnaire/question/answer without previously doing a
    login and accessing directly to the corresponding URL, (b) it is not possible to
    create answers guess without knowing the game.publicId, etc.
If the following criteria are accomplished, a grade up to 8.9 might be achieved:
     All the previous criteria are accomplished completely.
    NOT YET  Every test and all the run checks output success results.
    WTF HOW  If we reduce the size of the browser window or use the zoom, all the elements
    in the page are still accessible and no functionality is lost.
To aim for the maximum grade, the following criteria must be accomplished:
     All the previous criteria are accomplished completely.
    NOT YET  The coverage for the files that contain the models, views, and forms is over
    99%.
    NO  Sound in pages seen by participants was implemented.

Note: Late submission → take away a point for each late day (or fraction) in the
submission.
Note: The code used in the assessment of the assignment will be the one submitted
to Moodle. Under no circumstance, the existing code in Render.com, Github, or any
other repository will be used.
