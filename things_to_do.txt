Evaluation criteria
Note: When grading this assessment, the aesthetics will NOT be considered (it will
be evaluated in the next assignment).
To pass with 5 points it is necessary to satisfy the following criteria completely:
    YES  All the needed files to run the application have been submitted on time.
    YES  The code was stored in a git repository and this repository is private.
    YES  The file uploaded to Moodle contains a git repository.
    YES  The script populate.py exists and is functional.
    YES  The application can be executed locally.
    YES  When running the tests in local, the number of fails is not larger than four and
    the code that satises the tests is functional.
    YES  The code of the tests was not modied.
    YES  The application works against the database created in https://neon.tech
    and implemented using PostgreSQL.
    YES  The database admin application is deployed and accessible in the local Django
    server using as user name and password alumnodb.
    YES  It is possible to create and remove objects belonging to all the requested models
    using the admin application.
    CHECK  IMPORTANT: we need https://neon.tech URI in order to grade this assignment. Please write it down in a le called env and place it in the proyect
    root directory.
If the following criteria are accomplished, a grade up to 6.9 might be achieved:
     All the criteria in the previous paragraph are totally satised.
    NOT YET  The application is deployed in Render.com. In the le settings.py the path to
    Render.com is assigned to the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS. Besides being deployed,
    the application works correctly in Render.com.
    YES  The code submitted to Moodle is identical to the one deployed in Render.com.
    YES  The database admin application is deployed and accessible in Render.com using
    as user name and password alumnodb.
    YES  It is possible to create and remove objects belonging to all the requested models
    using the admin application.
    YES  All the templates inherit from base.html.
    NOT YET  IMPORTANT: If you update the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS using a enviroment
    variable add it to the env le.
If the following criteria are accomplished, a grade up to 7.9 might be achieved::
     All the criteria in the previous paragraph are totally satised.
    YES  Render.com is deployed in production mode. DEBUG=FALSE and SECRET_KEY is
    not stored in settings.py.
    YES  All the views (classes/methods implemented in views.py) inherit from classes.
    YES  When the tests are executed, the number of fails is not larger than two and
    the code that satises the tests is functional.
    NOT YET  The code is readable, ecient, well-structured, and commented.
    IG  The tools provided by the framework are used.
     The following are examples of the previous points:
        YES?  Every form that involves a model is created in such a way that it inherits
        directly or indirectly from class forms.Form.
        YES  The searches are done by the database. Do not not load all the elements
        of a table and implement the search in the views dened in view.py.
        CHECK  The errors are properly processed and understandable message errors are
        returned.
        NOT YET  The code presents a consistent style and the functions are commented
        including their author. Note: the author of a function must be unique.
        CHECK  The style criteria highlighted by Flake8 are applied in a coherent way.
        Flake8 does not return any error when executed on the code programmed
        by the student.
    CHECK It is impossible to impersonate a user (or participant) without knowing their
    user name and password (or game.publicId). For example: (a) it is not possible to modify a questionnaire/question/answer without previously doing a
    login and accessing directly to the corresponding URL, (b) it is not possible to
    create answers guess without knowing the game.publicId, etc.
If the following criteria are accomplished, a grade up to 8.9 might be achieved:
     All the previous criteria are accomplished completely.
    YES  Every test and all the run checks output success results.
    WTF HOW  If we reduce the size of the browser window or use the zoom, all the elements
    in the page are still accessible and no functionality is lost.
To aim for the maximum grade, the following criteria must be accomplished:
     All the previous criteria are accomplished completely.
    YES  The coverage for the files that contain the models, views, and forms is over
    99%.
    NO  Sound in pages seen by participants was implemented.

Note: Late submission → take away a point for each late day (or fraction) in the
submission.
Note: The code used in the assessment of the assignment will be the one submitted
to Moodle. Under no circumstance, the existing code in Render.com, Github, or any
other repository will be used.

Summary of the work to be done during the rst half of the assignment
Create a Django project called kahootclone that includes the applications models
and services, satisfying the following requirements:
    YES  The project will include an admin page (Django interface in path http://
    hostname:8001/admin/) that allows to introduce and remove data. Both the
    user name and password for admin user must be alumnodb.
    YES  Data must be persisted in a PostgreSQL database stored in https://neon.
    tech.
    YES?  The models application will include the data model described in subsection 2.3
    included in script populate.py.
    YES  The created code must satisfy the tests dened in models.tests_authentication
    and models.test_models.
    YES  The coverage of les models.py must be 100%. The request of 100% coverage
    applies exclusively to the code you create. Ignore the code created by Django
    or the one provided by the teachers.
    YES  The services application will include at least all the services related to the
    questionnaire (those whose alias starts with questionnarie) and the one needed
    to create the starting page (alias home) (see section 2.6).
    YES  The created code must satisfy at least the rst six tests dened in services.test_services.py.
    YES  All the Python code you write must satisfy the style requirement highlighted
    by the ake8 utility. This requirement is not extensible to the code generated
    automatically by Django or the code provided by your teachers.
    YES The views (views.py) must be implemented using classes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Work to be presented when the assignment ends
    YES  Make sure your code satises all the provided tests. Unless specied
    otherwise, it is not acceptable to modify the code in the tests.
    YES  Implement all the tests you consider necessary to cover the developed functionality. These tests must be implemented in a le called
    test_additional.py.
    NOT YET  Include a le called coverage.txt in the project root that contains the result
    of running the command coverage for all the tests.
    YES  Deploy and test the application in Render.com in production mode (DEBUG=False, SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL in an environment
    variable).
    NOT YET  Upload to Moodle the obtained le when running the command zip -r
    ../assign4_final.zip .git from the root of the project. Remember you
    have to add and commit the les to git before running that command. If
    you want to check the content of the zip le is correct, you may do it by
    running the command: cd ..; unzip assign4_final.zip; git clone
    . tmpDir; ls tmpDir.
    NOT YET  Verify the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS from le settings.py included in the
    submission includes your deployment path in Render.com (if it does not
    appear, we will grade the assignment as if the project was not deployed in
    Render.com). In the same way, check in Render.com that your user name
    and password for admin are alumnodb.

    CHECK  IMPORTANT: we need https://neon.tech URI in order to grade this assignment. Please write it down in a le called env and place it in the proyect
    root directory.

    NOT YET  IMPORTANT: If you update the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS using a enviroment
    variable add it to the env le.

    NOT YET  The application is deployed in Render.com. In the le settings.py the path to
    Render.com is assigned to the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS. Besides being deployed,
    the application works correctly in Render.com.
    NOT YET  Verify the variable ALLOWED_HOSTS from le settings.py included in the
    submission includes your deployment path in Render.com (if it does not
    appear, we will grade the assignment as if the project was not deployed in
    Render.com). In the same way, check in Render.com that your user name
    and password for admin are alumnodb.

    YES  Deploy and test the application in Render.com in production mode (DEBUG=False, SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL in an environment
    variable).
